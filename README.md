## RBF Interpolation and Kansa's Method in Non-Euclidean Spaces

This contains code as well as a short document associated with an independant study that I did during the spring semester of 2024 with Professor Anil Hirani at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign.

The key goals of this independant study were:

- To see if using a metric intrinsic to a surface was more effective for reconstructting functions on surfaces.
- To display the ability to perform Kansa's method on surfaces using a metric intrinsic to the surface.

The independant study accomplished both of these goals. There is a much more detailed description of the method and results in IndependantStudyFinalRelsuts.pdf. The classes I wrote and used for this project are in the kansa and MRBF python scripts and they are used in the jupyter notebooks surfaceKansa and surfaceRBF.
